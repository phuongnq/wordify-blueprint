## Requirement

- NodeJS >= 16

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Make sure your Crafter Studio is up and opened at port 8080: [http://localhost:8080/studio](http://localhost:8080/studio) and current site is `wordify` from [wordify-blueprint](https://github.com/craftercms/wordify-blueprint).
